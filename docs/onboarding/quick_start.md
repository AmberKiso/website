Once installation is complete, start your node by running the following command:
```sh
ironfish start
```

Your node will attempt to connect to the Iron Fish testnet and begin to sync the blockchain.

Next, sign up for the incentivized testnet [here](https://testnet.ironfish.network/signup).

Open a new terminal window.

Set your graffiti and node name from your testnet account by running:

```sh
ironfish testnet
```

## Next steps
Now that your graffiti is set up, you can start mining or explore the other CLI commands.
